# kstrk

kstrk (Keystroke) is a command-line tool for practicing typing and testing your typing speed. Inspired heavily by [monkeytype](https://monkeytype.com), it brings a similar experience to your terminal.

This project was created primarily for fun and to explore the possibilities of using ANSI escape codes in the terminal.
